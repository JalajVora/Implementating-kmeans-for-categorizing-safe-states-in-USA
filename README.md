# Implementating-kmeans-for-categorizing-safe-states-in-USA

This project is done as part of course entitled *Business Intelligence and Data Mining* provided at [Dr. Jivraj Mehta Institute of Technology](https://www.djmit.ac.in/) for students of B.Engg. in Computer Science and Engineering.

This project implements concepts of k-Means an unsupervised Data Mining algorithm to cluster states of USA being Safe, Moderate or Critical. The dataset from [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-4/) was used as ground truth.
